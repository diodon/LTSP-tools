Timestamps are chronologically ordered, but may not be at uniform intervals. Instrument details are stored as a variable in order to keep a record of the origin of each measurement. The quality control flags of the variable of interest and DEPTH are preserved. Out-of-water measurements have been excluded, but no other filtering has been applied to the input data.",

        "lineage": "The variable of interest (VoI) is produced by sequentially concatenating the individual values in each of the input files. The resulting variable has dimension OBSERVATION. The VoI's ancillary_variables, in particular the corresponding quality-control flags, are also included, with dimension OBSERVATION. If the quality control variable is absent in any input file, the corresponding flags in the output file will be set to 0 ('no QC performed'). The variable TIME from input files is concatenated into a variable TIME(OBSERVATION). This could result in a non-uniform time interval. The DEPTH variable from input files is concatenated into a variable DEPTH(OBSERVATION). If not present, fill values are stored. DEPTH_quality_control, if present, is also included. Where  the DEPTH variable is absent, the corresponding DEPTH_quality_control values are set to 9 ('missing value'). The variables PRES (sea_water_pressure) and PRES_REL (sea_water_pressure_due_to_sea_water) are aggregated in exactly the same way as DEPTH. All output variables with the INSTRUMENT dimension are sorted in chronological order. In order to keep track of the provenance of VoI in the aggregated file, accessory variables are created. After the aggregation, this file combines TEMP and PSAL from the SAME instrument from the SAME deployment in one file."
