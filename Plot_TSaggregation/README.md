# Some tools for aggregated timeseries product

Here few python notebooks with tools for plotting and managing the AODN aggregated timeseries products

- [plotTSagg](https://github.com/diodon/LTSP-tools/blob/master/Plot_TSaggregation/Plot_TSagg.ipynb): simple tool for plotting the ragged array aggregated product
- [TSresample](https://github.com/diodon/LTSP-tools/blob/master/Plot_TSaggregation/TSresample.ipynb): Average the time series to 1-hour intervals per instrument. Also produce some plots. The secod product of the LTSp will produce a file with all variables binned at 1-hour interval for one site.
